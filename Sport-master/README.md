##Sport v2 compatible with the new Azure App Services
I'm posting a very early build of Sport v2 that connects to Azure App Services and uses the latest of all libraries/SDKs. I have not done a super thorough job of testing yet so please keep that in mind. This includes a lot of changes to both the front and back ends.

Changes include:

Updated to Forms 2.3
Azure App Service support
Converted to use PCL instead of Shared Projects
Local data store now uses Azure Offline Sync
Other various updates to support the latest from 3rd party frameworks/libs

Sport is a Xamarin.Forms app initially built for Xamarin employees as a way to facilitate leaderboards for a few ping-pong tables and darts we have around the office.
Athletes can join leagues, get ranked and challenge other athletes to move up the ladder. As of 8/30/2015, Sport features 93.6% code share (3.3% iOS / 3.1% Android).

#### This project excercises the following platforms, frameworks or features:
* Xamarin.iOS
  * Push notifications
* Xamarin.Android
  * Push notifications
* Xamarin.Forms
  * XAML
  * Bindings
  * Converters
  * Central Styles
  * Custom Renderers
  * Animations
  * IoC
  * Messaging Center
  * Custom Controls
  * MessageBar library
  * ImageCircle Plugin
  * Connectivity Plugin
* Xamarin Insights
* Xamarin Test Cloud
  * UITest
  * Extensions
  * single code-base for iOS & Android
* Azure Mobile Services
  * C# backend
  * cross-platform templated push notifications


#### This project employs a few patterns listed below:
* Enforces a ViewModel-per-Page concept
  * all `ContentPage` classes enforce a generic `BaseViewModel` type
  * automatically set as the binding context
* All tasks are proxied through a `RunSafe` method
  * verifies connectivity
  * gracefully handles and reports exceptions
* Leagues are assigned a randomly selected themed color at runtime


#### Keys
* Default keys have been provided to connect to an existing Azure instance
  * You will need to create your own app in Google Developer Console to generate a GCM Sender ID if you wish to test out push notifications
  * Insights integration has been abstracted if no valid key is detected - insert your own API key to enable Insights functionality
* If you wish to stand up your own backend, you will need to replace the existing fields in Keys.cs file for Azure, OAuth (Google), Xamarin Insights, Xamarin Test Cloud and Flickr
* To run the included UITest suite, you'll need to provide a test Google email address and password


#### Notes
* You will need a valid Google account to log into the application
* Parallax feature should be tested on a device - simulator will cause jitter
